CALL +1 316-219-4911 to hear the demo 


InterVision is embarking on a project to build a state-of-the-art, 100-agent Amazon Connect contact center that leverages a wide range of AWS services to deliver exceptional customer experiences, optimize operational efficiency, and drive continuous improvement. This contact center will have a strong focus on conversational flow, minimizing wait times, and reducing caller frustration. Here's a detailed technical summary of the project:

1. **Conversational Flow and Call Deflection**:
   - **Amazon Lex**: Building conversational chatbots and IVR systems using Amazon Lex will involve defining intents, utterances, slots, and fulfillment lambdas. Natural language models like BERT will be utilized for intent classification and slot filling. Chatbots and IVRs will be integrated with Amazon Connect using AWS Lambda functions and Amazon API Gateway.
   - **Call Deflection Options**:
     - **Contact Form**: A serverless web application built with AWS Amplify and hosted on Amazon S3 will provide a dynamic contact form. Upon submission, the form data will be stored in Amazon DynamoDB, and a notification will be sent to agents via Amazon SNS.
     - **Voice Messaging**: Callers will be prompted to leave a voice message, which will be recorded and stored in Amazon S3. Amazon Transcribe will transcribe the audio, and the transcript will be stored in Amazon DynamoDB. Agents will receive notifications via Amazon SNS and can access the transcripts through the agent desktop.
     - **Text Messaging**: Amazon Pinpoint will be used for two-way text messaging. Incoming texts will be routed to a serverless application built with AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway, which will either respond with a chatbot or escalate to an agent.
     - **Generative AI Bot**: A state-of-the-art generative AI bot will be built using Amazon CodeWhisperer and AWS AI services like Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Translate. The bot will be deployed as a serverless application using AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway, integrated with Amazon Connect.

2. **Minimizing Wait Times and Caller Frustration**:
   - **Real-time Metrics and Analytics**: Amazon Connect's real-time metrics and Contact Lens analytics will provide insights into contact center performance, queue times, customer sentiment, and agent performance. Custom metrics and dashboards will be built using Amazon QuickSight and AWS Lambda functions.
   - **Queue Management**: Prerecorded messages and estimated wait time updates will be played to callers in the queue using Amazon Connect's built-in queue management features. The messages will be stored in Amazon S3 and managed through the Amazon Connect admin console.
   - **Intelligent Routing**: Amazon Connect's Bedrock will be utilized for intelligent routing and skill-based routing. Routing strategies will be defined based on agent skills, customer attributes, and real-time queue conditions. Custom routing logic will be implemented using AWS Lambda functions.
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Amazon Transcribe and Comprehend will be used to analyze call transcripts and customer sentiment. Transcripts will be stored in Amazon S3, and sentiment analysis will be performed using AWS Lambda functions. Insights will be used for proactive issue resolution and agent coaching.

3. **AWS Service Integration**:
   - **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 will be used for secure storage of call recordings, transcripts, and other data. Lifecycle policies will be implemented for data retention and archiving, with glacierization and object expiration rules.
   - **Notifications and Alerts**: Amazon SNS will be integrated for real-time notifications and alerts to agents, supervisors, and administrators. Topics and subscriptions will be managed through AWS CloudFormation templates and AWS Lambda functions.
   - **Customer Engagement**: Amazon Pinpoint will be used for targeted communication campaigns, personalized customer engagement, and capturing customer preferences and feedback. Pinpoint segments will be defined based on customer attributes stored in Amazon DynamoDB.
   - **Infrastructure Provisioning**: AWS CloudFormation templates will be employed for automated provisioning and consistent deployment of the contact center infrastructure, including Amazon Connect instances, Amazon ECS clusters, AWS Lambda functions, and other resources.
   - **Operational Data Storage**: Amazon DynamoDB will serve as a scalable and high-performance database for storing customer data, agent profiles, contact center configurations, and other operational data. DynamoDB Streams and AWS Lambda functions will be used for real-time data processing and integration with Amazon Connect.

4. **State-of-the-Art and Highly Functional**:
   - **Continuous Improvement and Optimization**: Regular monitoring, analysis, and adaptation based on customer feedback, operational data, and evolving business needs will be carried out using services like Amazon QuickSight, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon CloudWatch.
   - **Security and Compliance**: Robust security measures, including encryption at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS), strict access controls with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), and compliance with industry standards like PCI-DSS and HIPAA, will be implemented. AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail will be used for continuous monitoring and auditing.
   - **Agent Experience**: Agents will have access to a unified desktop experience, with integrated softphone, customer data, and knowledge base, enabled by services like Amazon Connect Workforce Management and Amazon Kendra. The agent desktop will be built using AWS Amplify and hosted on Amazon S3.
   - **Scalability and High Availability**: The contact center infrastructure will be designed for scalability and high availability, leveraging AWS services like Amazon ECS for container orchestration, AWS Auto Scaling for dynamic scaling, and AWS Route 53 for DNS routing and failover.

By leveraging these AWS services and implementing advanced technical solutions, InterVision's 100-agent Amazon Connect contact center will provide a state-of-the-art, highly functional, and secure customer experience while optimizing operational efficiency, agent productivity, and cost-effectiveness. The contact center will be designed for scalability, continuous improvement, and adaptation to evolving business needs.
